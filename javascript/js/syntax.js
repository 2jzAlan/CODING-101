//The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
//Fixed values are called Literals.
//---Numbers are written with or without decimals
//--Strings are text, written within double or single quotes
//Variable values are called Variables.

//JavaScript Variables: are used to store data values.
//JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.

//Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
//A Identifier must begin with:
//A letter (A-Z or a-z)
//A dollar sign ($)
//Or an underscore (_)

//Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtractions.
//JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
//Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

let a;
a = 6;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = a;
//An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
//JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
//The "let" keyword tells the browser to create variables:

document.getElementById("demoTwo").innerHTML = (5 + 6) * 10;
//Operators uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values
//Expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

var x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
document.getElementById("demoThree").innerHTML = x + y;
//the = operator is used to assign values to variables.
//Expressions can also contain variable values:
//The "var" keyword also tells the browser to create variables:

let lastName;
firstName = "Alan";
lastName = "Giraldo";
document.getElementById("demoFour").innerHTML = lastName;
//All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
//The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:
//JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let.
